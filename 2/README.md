Lab #2
======

What was used: JS/HTML/CSS

The application was built for desktop using appJS SDK
that allows one to develop desktop tools and applications
using the same libraries and knowledge used to build websites.

The application was built on Linux and therefore has a script 
to be launched on Linux. 
To do that, go to YOUR_PATH/pizza_app and run bash app.sh

In order to launch the app on other platforms, different SDK "bundle"
has to be used.
